I have noticed that many startup founders often share that they are
too busy to read. When I hear this statement, I understand it be a hedge.
They are busy, and reading for fun is a beach activity. It can feel like
a luxury.

But.

When founders talk to each other about what they read, I hear something
very different. Founders read for effect and impact. They read to learn.
A different mindset can change a go to market strategy. It can radically change
how a founding teams approach their belief in what is possible.

So here is my reading list.

#### 1. "Never Split the Difference" <small style="font-weight: 200;">- Chris Voss</small>

I found this book in the months right after we graduated from the 2018 TechStars
Boston program. A number of the founders from the program moved from the WeWork in
Fort Point to GSV Labs in the downtown area. As we exited the program, we all went
through an adjustment period. During the TechStars we tried out a suite of tools
and products. When the trial periods were over, we had to make the call; 'keep'
or 'dump'. Getting out of a contract is not fun, but it can be done! Getting a complete
refund from a pre-paid contract is even less fun.

This book gave me an approach to negotiations that I have used ever since.

I read random capture from this book every time I enter a negotiation. I find that
even a short read can make a difference. It gets me back a listening mode that yields
better results.

    <b>TLDR</b>: Chris Voss was an FBI hostage negotiator. Some years ago the FBI figured
    out they were loosing too many hostages when negotiations failed. They came up with
    a better way. This book is the results. It's a power tool for startup founders.

#### 2. "Venture Deals" <small style="font-weight: 200;">- Brad Feld & Jason Mendelson</small>

Simple book, easy read, but a dense topic. Brad and Mendelson break down terms sheets, and tease
apart each component, from two sides: From the VC/Investor side, and the startup founder. I
have found that this book got me to rethink the entire fundraising process.

In the past I took the approach that we needed to tell a complete store to the investor. This
back and forth narrative got me to think about the entire process as a negotiation. As a sharing
of interests. As a process of understanding what the investors were looking for.

A startup founder needs to understand investment theory. I read parts of this book every time
I talk to an investors. It gets me into their mindset. It took me years to understand that
the investment thinking was not founder thinking.

#### 3. "Meditations" <small style="font-weight: 200;">- Marcus Aurelius</small>

Again, simple book, long term utility. Founders have to believe in the impossible. When
everyone else says something is impossible, they have to believe it is possible. As with the
Voss book I carry this book. I got the paper back so I could make notes in it. I add dates
and topics to the margins, and it helps me remember that there is a burden in doing things
that are not easy.

Seeing those notes from past struggles reminds me to stay out of the details and focus
on the process.

    Nothing goes onto my long term reading list if it does not provide
    persistent utility. I keep my founders reading list short and focused.
