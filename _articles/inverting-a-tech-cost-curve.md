In any startup technology has a deep allure. A solid tech stack is a sign of success.
It's a sign of achievement. Its a sign of progress. It make the CEO feel like something
is built.

Its an anti-pattern.

Most companies that use technology to address their business plan are not tech companies.
In the purest sense, they are not tech companies. They are not building technology. They are
using technology to address their business plan.

This is a big deal. How a company views itself sets the pattern for how it approaches 
problems, and solutions. The myths and tropes of tech companies are pervasive, and 
almost without knowing it, we accept these as truth.

And we make tech decisions.

Most companies use technology because its their only way to achieve a goal.
This does not make them a tech company. Google, AWS are tech companies. They
hire and build and deploy technology.

Many SAS startups mix these truths. They are companies that use technology.
They do not think in terms how how they approach technology.

During my time at my last startup, we had a mantra we used to keep the
team aligned with our current mission. We would remind ourselves that
we use mufflers, do do not make them.

I think of this early mantra was a conceptual stepping stone to the
idea of technology as a curve. As a pattern that can be inverted.

##### Framing Concepts
I use these concepts to frame the conversation around technology. Both
for how I approach tech decisions for personal projects, and with my clients.

1. Use the least amount of code possible to achieve any goal.
2. Code is disposable, resist the user to make it permanent.
3. Every line of code needs to have a ROI objective.

##### Sunk-Cost Thinking
In every startup I have been involved in, technology use takes on characteristics
that mirror other business costs. Terms like 'tech debt' are used to describe
the challenges of keeping technology aligned with business goals. Sunk-Cost
thinking is the pattern of assuming long term value for code invested in a project.

As a given tech patterns gets locked in, a number of factors come into play.

When a team started to talk about re-reuse, its a sign that the code has moved
to being seen as the solution. I have found that the longer a team goes without
commiting to any one tech stack solution.

##### Code Refactors
A secondary sign of sunk-cost thinking is the call for code refactoring.

##### Long Term
