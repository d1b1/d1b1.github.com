<h3 id="sql-vs-no-sql">SQL vs No-SQL</h3>
<p>The long &amp; short of this concept is that you either have a very declarative data store that locks down fields and relationships or not.
In the end, the all work, and they store your data. In No-SQL you can data fields, names and structures on the fly, and handle the differences in code. In SQL
you have to do more work to change the way data is stored, but your code is
clear and more concise.</p>

<p>Here is a short reference list:</p>

<h3 id="how-we-choose">How we choose</h3>
<p>It might be surprising. Most startups think less about the impact of their applicationâ€™s database than they should. Often this is the domain of the
first developer on site, the first tech hire or just the opinion of the most technical person around the founder. This is not startup laziness. Itâ€™s because
founders do not assign much value to the database selection.</p>

<p>The dirty secret about developers is that we rarely think about the impact of SQL vs No-SQL storage options. Sometimes we know both solutions
and deployed production applications in each. But often we know whatâ€™s new, whatâ€™s worked, or the storage option we like the most. Our technology
decision-making rubrics are not mature. At least not until we get to the VP Eng or CTO level.</p>

<p>It should not be surprising, but developers have favorite solutions. Their preferences are fine, but not when assessing patterns that will speed up ROI or long-term support costs.</p>

<h3 id="rule-of-thumb">Rule of Thumb</h3>
<p>Without getting in a â€˜thisâ€™ database is better than that database argument, here are a few things to keep in mind.</p>

<p><strong>a. Need Flexibility Most</strong>
If you do not know or can not know how your data will be stored, then go with no-SQL. It will give you more flexibility when you
donâ€™t have specifics. Your front-end coder can solve issues.</p>

<p><strong>b. Need Flexibility Less</strong>
If you do know how your data will be stored, and do not expect that <strong>new information</strong>
will dramatically alter your thinking, then go with SQL.</p>

<p><strong>c. Known Security Concerns</strong>
If you know are going into a regulated space, then the category â€˜full managed datastoreâ€™ is worth
exploring. In that case, focus on GCP and AWS fully managed options. or Snowflake.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="when-needs-change">When Needs Change</h4>
<p>SQL comes with schemas and structure, but there are patterns that can be used to move between solutions. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma.io</a> is a perfect example. It makes schema, for either SQL/NoSQL approach a viable option. Additionally, solutions like Prisma, can help you scale load and costs in a cost-effective method long before you develop the technology team that will make better decisions.</p>
