<h3 id="my-low-code-cookbook">My Low Code Cookbook</h3>

<p>This is a personal project, driven by the pain and learnings of my last startup Meenta.io (R.I.P). We were a Techstars company
from the Boston 2018 program. We ran for six years and executed like crazy. We died when COVID-19 ended. We were not able to pivot
out of some of the business decisions driven by the pandemic supply chain requirements. As the CTO and Co-Founder, I was painfully
capital-efficient.</p>

<p>After exiting, I realized that I had written code for six years straight. Six years of writing code full-time. I realized I could rebuild
the entire stack in record time if I changed my mindset: “Code is CapEx”.</p>

<p>I devolved all the diagnostic workflow features, services and learnings and spent a year researching alternatives to building
in-house. This was a painful learning process! If I had had more context and perspective, while I was in the weeds, I would have
made very different decisions.</p>

<p>This is the core thesis of my fractional CTO practice.</p>

<p>A long story short, my research results in an Airtable, and that led to this. This is not a survey of the entire industry. It’s not
complete. It’s my view of a set of technology alternatives. Solutions that might have changed the arc of my startup.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="primary-criteria-the-stack-need">Primary Criteria: The ‘Stack Need’</h3>

<p>This is a larger set of tags that allow for mapping a given solution into a larger tech stack. If you think any given solution, it’s
a composite of different technologies that knit together. This is set up to make it easy to abstract the role and provide other
related solutions.</p>

<p>For example, show all the ‘Authentication’ solutions. This will yield any solution that solves this problem, in some way or form.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="secondary-criteria-the-type">Secondary Criteria: The ‘Type’</h3>

<p>The following are three categories that best group solution types. Another view of the these is as a ‘cost’ indicator.
Code costs more. Code takes longer. Teams are needed to support.</p>

<div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3 mb-3 text-center">
    <div class="col">
        <div class="card mb-4 rounded-3 shadow-sm border-primary">

            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                    This category denotes a solution, pattern or library that offers a pure
                    no-code experience. If the primary use case is code-less, then it gets this
                    status, even if other features can utilize some code.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled mt-3 mb-4">
                    <li>100% code free solution</li>
                    <li>Works with other low-code options.</li>
                    <li>Make Devs mad.</li>
                    <li>Low switching cost.</li>

                <p>
                    This category denotes solutions that lower the overall volume of code
                    in a given solution. So a library like Platformatic.dev, would be a low-code
                    solution. This is reserved for solutions that need a bit of code to customize
                    or delivery.

                <p>
                    This category is for solutions that support or enable the other two categories. It's a catch-all.
                    A no-code purist will __hate__ these solutions, but these solutions can help transition a traditional tech team
                    into new patterns.

                <ul class="list-unstyled mt-3 mb-4">
                    <li>Healthy Code Required</li>
                    <li>Developers are fine with it</li>

<h3 id="misc-criteria-founded-funding-etc">Misc Criteria: Founded, Funding etc.</h3>

<p>I have included a few other facets that I find helpful. When was a specific company founded? This is helpful for
understanding the maturity of a given solution. Funding helps with this understanding. <strong>Governance&lt;</strong> is a new category
I am working on, that let me know if I can expect an impact on my SOC2, if I get a BAA, etc.</p>

<p>Happy to take new entries. Happy to take your ideas. But in this mine, it solves my <a href="https://github.com/liftoff-app/liftoff/issues/423&quot;">tech itch</a>.</p>
