<p>Code deployment is just a code word for how you get your code from your local machine, or your developersâ€™ laptop to your site. This requirement is often something that gets added to a project after the team grows past its initial founders/coders.</p>

<p>In the old days when we only had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)">Jenkins</a> to work with, and the knowledge and experience to get this set up was high, it
was often left out. But that has changed, there are now vendors who offer this service.</p>

        The CEO TL;DR
    </h5>
    <p>
        As a CEO, you only care about this part of your stack because it provides you with tools to get features live <b>quickly</b> and <b>safely</b>.
        Having a developer log into a production AWS EC2 instance to push code to make it 'live', is a bad sign. This feature is cheap and pays off quickly.
    </p>

<h4 id="some-options-to-get-started">Some Options to get started</h4>

<p>Here are three good examples of (almost) turnkey simple deployment tools (aka CI/CD).</p>

            <b>Github Actions</b> - This feature was launched in 2018 and enables code build, testing and
            deployment with a few simple file changes to your Github repos. Getting setup with
            their actions take less than 30 minutes, and it has huge benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, it's <b>free</b> with an account. Second, it conditions your team to start
            using secrets to manage API keys etc. And finally, can be a good screening question
            for your new hires. (If they do not know about GitHub actions, then maybe they are too green to hire.

            Oh, <b>Codeship.io</b> (now owned by CloudBees). It has been a staple for dev teams for years. This company
            come through Techstars in 2011, has been offering perks for 10 years. They are very very startup-friendly.
            Ping their support team and they help. And more importantly, they support deployments from Github to either
            a docker contains or directly to their build environment.

            Last I heard, this was a Berlin-based startup! Killer product, very easy to configure, and 
            free for open-source, and affordable for private repos. It uses a local `yaml` file to configure 
            your deployment workflows.

        Having your deployment workflows stored in code is a huge win at SOC2 audit time. If you can show
        that your processes for deploying code are declarative, and tracked with version control (i.e. in Github) you are actually showing people that your company has already been complying with cyber security requirements. Basically, it's an easy win.
