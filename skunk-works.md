<h2 class="mb-3">"AI Networking Tool"</h2>
<p>
    A tool that helps me find and leverage my network for good. If you connect with me, join the community, or share new low-code tools, I'll use my network to find you connections that grow our vision.
</p>
<p>
    I'm building tools in OpenAI, Microsoft Graph, and other platforms to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" target="_blank">Dunbar Paradox</a>—the cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. How do we remember more connections, understand relationships better, and leverage networks more effectively?
</p>
<p>
    One tool I'm exploring is <a href="https://unfurl.network/" target="_blank">Unfurl</a>—a personal networking tool focused on networking with intention. It's helping me think about how to structure and maintain meaningful connections in a more deliberate way.

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">"Exo-Self"</h2>
<p>
    I've been thinking that the real and durable value of AI is how it gives us tools to break our own evolutionary constraints. How do we remember more? Recall faster? Think beyond the limits of our biological memory?
</p>
<p>
    This project explores using AI to augment human cognition—creating systems that help us overcome the natural limitations of how our brains work, enabling us to process more information, make better connections, and think more effectively.
</p>
<p>
    Sci-fi writers have written about the idea of onboard moderators that help us extend our personal context so we can see deeper into people's background data. I love the idea of tools that gently enhance my ability to see new ideas.
</p>

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">"AI Writing Engine"</h2>
<p>
    I don't like to let AI write for me, but I do like to have a UI that pulls and pushes ideas for me. Capturing the small essences of an idea and then linking them together is where idea and content innovation comes from.
</p>
<p>
    I'm building a Pinecone-powered suite of agents to capture how I think about ideas and allow myself to swim deeper into an idea space. The system helps me explore connections between concepts, surface related thoughts, and build on ideas organically—without AI doing the writing, but with AI helping me think better.

    <em>These are the kind of projects I do to get into a new idea. They're all designed to get me closer to pure idea-flow state. Another way to describe this: my intentional distractions.</em>
