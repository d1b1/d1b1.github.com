You have the vision. You have the idea. You're ready to build your tech company—but you don't have to do it alone.

As your fractional co-founder, I provide the support, experience, and structured guidance to accelerate your thinking and help you navigate every technical decision. You stay in the driver's seat, making the calls and owning the process, while I ensure you have access to the community, experts, and proven frameworks that get you to first customers and first revenue.

#### How It Works

**Weekly Cadence, Proven Process**

We meet weekly through a structured process designed to keep you moving forward. You drive the effort—I provide the acceleration. Each session builds on the last, ensuring steady progress from concept to launch.

- **Weekly strategic sessions** to accelerate your decision-making
- **Structured process** that guides you from idea to first revenue
- **Founder-to-founder support** without the full-time commitment
- **Access to community and experts** when you need specialized knowledge

#### What You Get

- Strategic guidance on technical decisions and architecture
- Weekly check-ins that keep momentum and accountability
- Proven frameworks and processes that have worked for other founders
- Access to a network of experts and community resources
- Founder-to-founder perspective on building your tech company
- Support that ensures you own every decision and outcome

#### The Result

You're in the driver's seat, making informed decisions with confidence. You own the process from start to finish, and when you're done, you're ready for your first customers and first revenue—not just with a product, but with the knowledge and experience to keep building.
