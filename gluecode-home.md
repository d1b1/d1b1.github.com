subtitle: Every dev hates the word 'gluecode'. It feels dirty, if you like building everything from the ground up. There is another way.

    <h5>
       Low-Code Components
    </h5>
    <p>
      This is a codex, there is no canon. This is just a collection of tools that, 
      when hung in a row, with the right mindset, provide the option to build solutions
      faster, with less code, and less vendor lock in.
    </p>
</div>

  <p>
    My first version of the low-code cookbooks (which is still up) was more of 
    spreedsheet, with search options. Where it only has 15 options, it was fine.
    But it outgrew the format. So this approach, while manual, is designed to 
    map to the thinking process I take when I start to map low-code and no-code
    options to a clients use case.

        This category is growing faster then expected. There are huge

        and can dramatically impact the costs, both in a good and a bad way.

        Enough people know about my strange obsesion with not doing the think
        that I have spent my career learnign to to; coding. Every week I zoom with CTOs, lead devs, and every time they hand me a new low code solution.

       First I will offer a simple disclaimer. This approach is my solution to breaking the
       curve of the tech curve. If you have a solution to submit, then the best way is to
       find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephansmithbc93/" target="linkedin">LinkedIn</a>, make a connection request and share. I do not really read email.
       (Voice mail is no-go)
