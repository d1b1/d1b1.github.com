### Do a frational code? (for you?)
Every fractional will answer this question differently. For me, the anwser is both
yes and no. Currently I only take on one coding client at a time.

### How many clients do you take on?
I work with three clients at a time. At most. This usually breaks down into
two advisory clients and one deep code client. In the past I would take on more,
but I have found that this balance works the best.

### How long will I need a fractional?
Again, depends upon your project. I have found that advisory engagement
usually run for three months. Basically, it take some time to understand the business,
some time to understand the founders, and some time to have an impact.

Advisory client never go away, they just grow out of my domain.
