### Do a frational code? (for you?)
Every fractional will answer this question differently. For me, the anwser is both
yes and no. Currently I only take on one coding client at a time.

### How many clients do you take on?
I work with three clients at a time. At most. This usually breaks down into
two advisory clients and one deep code client. In the past I would take on more,
but I have found that this balance works the best.
