##### Do a frational code? (for you?)
Every fractional will answer this question differently. For me, the anwser is both
yes and no. Currently I only take on one coding client at a time.

##### How many clients do you take on?
I work with three clients at a time. At most. This usually breaks down into
two advisory clients and one deep code client. In the past I would take on more,
but I have found that this balance works the best.

##### How long will I need a fractional?
Again, depends upon your project. I have found that advisory engagement
usually run for three months. Basically, it take some time to understand the business,
some time to understand the founders, and some time to have an impact.

Advisory client never go away, they just grow out of my domain.

##### Can I hire you for just an hour?
Hells yes, sometimes an hour is all a founder needs to evolve their 
thinking and move forward. (Here is the calendar [link](https://calendly.com/stephan-smith/on-demand))

No package or letter of intent needed. Just book the time you want.

##### Are there clients you do not take?
Yes, I stay in my lane. If a client needs what I can not offer, then 
I have a huge network of other fractional CTOs I can pull in and/or hand
off to.

##### Do you work for equity?
Err - No. I find equity clouds the conversation. There are time when it makes
sense, but for the most part this is not an option.

##### How do I terminate a CTO relationship?
Easy, when things do not work, the relationship ends. I stay away from
long and involved contracts. I operate the way lawyers operate. I offer a 
single letter of intent.

Simple is easier.

##### Can I pay you after I raise XXXX?
No. I know the feeling and the desire to have someone working and helping
you get to a fundraise. In my experience, it's a bad idea. Fundraising always
takes too long. Missing fundraising deadlines can kill a good working relationships.

Founders do not need extra stress during a raise.

##### Can you help me with a fundraise?
Yes. Within bounds. First I have a huge network of founders, investors and 
advisors. There are countless ways I can help. But in the end, only the founder/CEO
can raise.

It's one of the only things that founders kind of have to do on their own.

##### Do you fire client?
Yes, but very very soldom. Fireing a client means I did not choose well.
And. I value network, having a client relationship end with a firing is
not the way I operate.

For me its like dropping a college class when I get a bad grade. Just not my style.

##### What do you want a founder to carry with them after working with you?
Easy question, but hard answer quickly.

- **Automomy** - I want a founder to own their idea. Value my input, but more importantly
have the tools to move the concept forward. If I was hit by a bus, the company and 
team might slow down, but the core ideas are not lost.

- **Enabled** - My ideas are not really mine. I talke to hundreds of founders and CTOs
every year. I learn from smarter people. So I want the founders I work with to feel 
enabled and powerful. Don't credit me. Anything I share it the founders to own!

- **Socialized** - I highly value network. I network like an olympian. Seriously. I want
founders to feel that after working with me, they are plugged into an huge and growing 
network. This goal grew out of the benefits I gains while in the 2018 Techstars program.

The spring cohort was amazing. I learned a ton, but I value the network and the connections
I made. I remain in contact with many of the founders and advisors from the period. 

Network is everything.
