<p>CEOs and Product Owners have all heard this refrain!</p>

<p>It causes stress. It adds time to the roadmap and stresses out teams. This article is a quick exploration of this character trait of developers.</p>

<p>We do not do this to annoy. And we are not trying to slow down a project.</p>

<p>To understand why this pattern is so common, it can help to unpack the mind of a developer. While code is complex and sophisticated, the reason
why developers default to this approach is simple, if you understand the mindset of your tech team.</p>

<h4 id="its-more-fun-to-start-fresh">Itâ€™s more fun to start fresh</h4>

<p>Most developers when faced with changing requirements will, at some point, mentally throw up their hands and option for a ground-up rebuild. i.e. a refractor.</p>

<h4 id="technology-back-pressure">Technology Back Pressure?</h4>

<p>There are three major factors putting pressure on developers. New cloud solutions &amp; approaches, new vendors and products and new code libraries.</p>

<p>Example. In 2012 I attended the second Backbone.js conference in Boston. Backbone JS was a short-lived, but wonderful library that provides views,
models and controllers for the new patterns coming up with single-page applications (aka SPAs). This libraryâ€™s lifespan was short-lived. Measured
in months. The evolution of libraries and frameworks like Angular, Vue and React supplanted Backbone.js within eighteen months.</p>

<p>Sadly, there was no Backbone.js Conf the next year.</p>

<p>At the time we all were using Underscore.js, a library for array and object collections work that had grown out of the New York Times Data visualization
team and their grants from the Knight Foundation. During the conference, a presenter launched a new library called LoDash (a play on the keyboard
underscore character). This new library took the patterns of Underscore.js and added browser hacks that added dramatic speed improvements. It was
lauded as a drop-in replacement.</p>

<p>I watched as developers learned about the drop in replacement value of this new library, opened their laptops, and hot-swapped the library. <b>At a conference,
during a presentation!</b> It was amazing to see how much developers love the new shiny and sexy library.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For reference, hot-swapping a library at a conference is not a good pattern.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="code-complexity">Code Complexity</h4>

<p>One of the unstated reasons that developers recommend replacement is code complexity. It takes a lot of time to learn a new codebase, internalize
the patterns and then get comfortable enough to start making changes.</p>

<p>We are not lazy, we just always think starting fresh is easier, better, or faster. We do not want to own someone elseâ€™s code. We do not
(really) think they did it well. Developers love to curb-stomp the views developers work. My code is always better. :)</p>

<h4 id="how-to-push-back">How to push back?</h4>

<p>There is no simple solution. Being forewarned is the first step. Refactors come with their own unique set of risks. One approach is to request the
developer to provide a detailed assessment of the reasons why the current solutions are not viable. Detailed, is not a verbal summary. Forcing a
developer to take the time to outline specifics, can sometimes break the spell.</p>

<p>If you have a developer who catches themselves, and is self-aware enough of the trap and owns up to the emotional desire to start fresh, then you
have a <b>keeper</b>. Give that developer a title bump, and hold them close.</p>

<p>A second approach is to have the developer do a â€˜replacement cost estimateâ€™, using off-the-shelf options only. Force the developer to play devilâ€™s
advocate and do the work to find existing solutions that could replace custom-built solutions can really help surface hidden issues.</p>

<h4 id="developers-hate-other-developers-code">Developers hate other Developerâ€™s code</h4>

<p>This is not surprising. What master chef wants to work from another chefâ€™s recipes? Itâ€™s no different for developers. We hate how other developers
name their files, name their methods and organize the classes. Hate is not too strong a word.</p>

<p>Almost all developers are smart enough to keep this fact hidden. We know it makes us look like snowflakes and a bit crazy. For non-technical
leaders, the idea that some code is â€˜specialâ€™ and other code is â€˜badâ€™ is a foreign concept. How would any business person know?</p>

<h4 id="better-buying-patterns">Better buying patterns</h4>

<p>A final piece of the developer mindset; is that we always think we can build something better. We all know intellectually that the core libraries
we use are amazing. We know that code written and tested by thousands of other smart coders is always more stable and scalable. But we still will find
reasons to write out our â€˜methodâ€™, and not use the â€˜methodâ€™ already imported from a system package.</p>

<p>I have watched developer convince themselves that they need to build their own custom form validation class and ignore the Angular Form API, because
of personal desire to do it better. If a global survey was possible, I predict that most code bases have both versions in their code; loaded library method,
and localized custom version.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Custom code is never as good as code written and vetted by the crowd (open source).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep this in mind when you are faced with the statement: We need to refactor.</p>

<h4 id="wrap-up">Wrap UP</h4>

<p>Expect to be told that the current solution, with customers and revenue, is no good and a full bottom-up rebuild is needed. Expect to hear about security
issues, memory leaks and testing problems. These are the tools of the developer who wants new tools, a new approach or simply just value their work more
than others.</p>

<p>The answer is that code serves revenue. Perfect code does not generate perfect revenue. No customer purchases a SAS product because the code was â€˜cleanâ€™,
the API integration was beautiful and the CI/CD processes were 10x faster.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to simply do not respond. :) Smile and say nothing.</p>

<p>Developers are not children, but distractions work. Give a developer the option of a refactor, or a new and complex stack component to integrate, and you might
be able to redirect them long enough have get past the minefield.</p>
