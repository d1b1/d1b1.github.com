#### Current Stage
[SprintReview.ai](https://SprintReview.ai) is a very early-stage, pre-funding startup. It has some seasoned founders, who know the value
of getting the right feedback as they set their first stage features. We need 3-5 design partners
who will be willing to take part.

#### My Background
I love this startup's <b>mission</b>.

In 2025 I left a dev lead role at a startup in Boston. On the way out of the door, I outlined a
data-centric approach to tech engineering management. Focus on the data [of your teams]. All the
insights you need are in the data. It was a gut feeling and shared informally.

It was received differently.

I told my replacement, to build a spreadsheet. Keep track of startup times, the # of commits per day. Work
over the weekend. Sprint bleed, refactors, branch-to-PR durations. When a developer had a vacation last.

Collect the <b>soft data</b>, and look for <b>signals</b>.

Three years later I got validation. By 2018 I was running tech/product for a venture-backed
startup. The engineering manager and I had beers to catch up. He shared the outcome of this
approach.

I learned that he had done exactly what I had suggested. And it worked. He has since moved
from being a <b>"technology-centric"</b> manager to <b>"developer-centric"</b> engineering leader. Taking a data science
approach to understanding what a team needs can be a game changer.

The insights from this informal process gave him insights into when to train some team
members, when to send someone to a conference, and when to give a day off. When to buy a lunch, how 
to focus a one-on-one meeting.

This startup is doing the same!

#### Expectations
3-4 Meetings

#### Criteria
Here is what we are looking for:
- Managers of technology teams of ~25-45.
- Managers with 3-5 years of large team dev processes.
- High EQ, servant leaders.
- Future CEOs and CTOs.
- Bug tolerant. Willing to share how they understand the needs of their teams.

--- 
#### Pain Points
We are looking for managers who have a clear understanding of:
- <b>Need for Enhanced Productivity Measurement:</b> Struggling to accurately measure and improve the productivity of their development teams.
- <b>High Turnover Rates:</b> Facing challenges with developer retention and seeking ways to identify and retain top talent.
- <b>Performance Management:</b> performance management is disliked and inefficient (even the best performance management systems are pretty terrible, just forms sent on a schedule, no data)

---
#### Best Fit for Program
I am looking for engineering managers who already know that they have signals hidden in
their current Git repos, which will enable them to be better managers. These managers need to
be early adaptors and see this program as a competitive advantage for their companies, teams and their
own professional advancement.

---
#### Bad Fits
HR, CEOs, CTOs. This is not aimed at the manager of managers. We need feedback from people
who expect to use the insights to have an impact. :)
