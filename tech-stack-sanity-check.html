                        <li class="mb-3">• Are there <b>systems that work</b> but feel expensive to maintain?</li>
                        <li class="mb-3">• Has your <b>tech stack grown faster</b> than your understanding of it?</li>
                        <li class="mb-3">• Are <b>decisions quietly compounding</b> while your team keeps shipping?</li>
                        <li class="mb-3">• Do you have <b>architectural choices</b> that made sense then, but feel uncertain now?</li>
                        <li class="mb-0">• Have <b>vendor relationships</b> started simple and become complex?</li>

                        Our 30-minute call is a conversation to see if we're a fit. I offer a <b>fixed-price, time-boxed assessment</b> 
                        that gives you a second set of eyes on your tech decisions—helping you see which decisions still make sense 
                        and which ones don't. This isn't about prescriptions; it's about <b>clarifying tradeoffs</b> so you can decide.
