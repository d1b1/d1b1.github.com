This is a primer for the CEOs of the world who work with tech people and find
the words they use confusing. If you are being told you need a full refactor, for
a product that seems to be fine. This is the primer for you. 

#### CDN
CDN just means content delivery network. It's a way to host images or files on the internet
in a manner that allows a company to lower the cost for hosting, and speed up delivery. It comes
down to this, an image faster (in a browser or app) because it has been pre-distributed across
the world, and one of these servers containing the image, is right down the street from you.

The TLDR - faster load times for images that do not change much, like your company logo.

#### No-Code
Vendor or Saas Product that replaces an entire block of work or code that would normally be
build from scratch by a developer. For a Product Owner its means they can setup an deploy a 
solution to a customer with the assistance of a developer. For the developer, it means they 
work on other stuff. 

### Low-Code 
Patterns that allow less code for a given application. For the CEO it means cheaper and faster.
For the Product Owners, it means they can expect smaller tickets in their agile process and more
velocity. For the developer, it means they have to use existing solution/pattern versus building
it from scratch.

#### Code Refactor
It just means 'build it all again' because someone on your team wants to.

#### SQL
This stands for Structure Query Language. Basically, its a language, like France or Spanish,
that tells a database to return different types of data, depending upon the need.
