title: Drupal Integration with AWS Route 53
summary: Skunkworks project to find a way to integrate a rapid distributed DNS service with Aegir.
tag: r53

<h2>Project</h2>
I did some work in early 2011 to allow a project to have a better way to handle DNS records, within the context of the Aegir, Drupal and the AWS Services. We were looking for a way to handle failover between EC2 regions. The Amazon Route 53 service provided a nice solution, but was very developer focused, and no AWS web interface. After digging into the r53 api, trying out a few of the existing desktop apps, I decided to integrate the feature directly into Aegir. 

<h2>Drupal.org SandBox</h2>
