<h3>The Challenge</h3>
Get up to speed on standalone CouchDB apps. 

<h3>The Solutions</h3>
There appear to be three visible pathways for a developer to build standalone CouchDB applications; "Reupholster":http://reupholster.iriscouch.com/reupholster/_design/app/index.html, "Soca":https://github.com/quirkey/soca and "CouchApp":https://github.com/jchris/couchapp. All of these projects take their own approach to the same approach. The provide a transaction application for a local file tree into a json document module. Each setups up the .CouchApp, Design document and attachments in a slightly different manner, and as of the writing of this post, are not really interchangeable. Once you choose an approach, you might find it less the enjoyable to switch tools, so try them out, and find one that works, and stick with it. 

CouchApp:https://github.com/jchris/couchapp - Python implementation, written by "Chris Anderson": http://jchrisa.net/

Soca:https://github.com/quirkey/soca - Ruby implementation, written by "Aaron Quint":http://www.quirkey.com/blog.

Reupholster:http://reupholster.iriscouch.com/reupholster/_design/app/index.html - Java implementaiton, written by unknown.

<h3>Associated Tools and Resources</h3>
The following are associated or embedded tools in the couch apps.

"Sammy.JS":http://sammyjs.org/ - This is a small javascript web framework that provides restful, event driven classes. It is used in the soca project to provide the connectivity between the client side javascript and the CouchDB API.

"Evently":https://github.com/jchris/evently - (Docs:http://couchapp.org/page/evently) This is a javascript project that provides DSL for event driven API applications. This is used in the the CouchApp project.
