        â€œStephan has been helping us in figuring out how we should get to
        SOC2 compliance within a reasonable budget. He's looked at our tech
        stack and gave us practical recommendations on how it should evolve
        over time. I'm looking forward to working with him again."

        "Stephan worked with our team as we started to scale up and address security requirements.
        He assisted in our selection of security frameworks that matched our unique funding, IP, and
        cyber-security needs. His startup experience provided us with options that matched our stage
        and immediate concerns. We hope to tap into his experience when our security requirements change."

        "We pulled in Stephan to build out our tech stack and API. He executed in record time,
        provided our front end teams with Just-in-Time API resources as we decided on email providers,
        payment gateways, hosting and storage options on AWS. He takes a very practical approach to solutions.
        He gave us both working solutions, as well as best practices for API route testing,
        JWT token security and a framework that we can hand off to a team to extend. He helped
        our team go from idea to revenue in 4 weeks. <b>Zero to MVP in record time!</b>"
