He brings clarity and practical solutions to our tech challenges, breaking down complex technical decisions into actionable steps. His ability to work alongside our team—rather than dictating solutions—has been invaluable. He understands growth-stage business challenges and provides guidance that aligns with both our immediate needs and long-term goals."

        "Stephan worked with our team as we started to scale up and address security requirements.
        He assisted in our selection of security frameworks that matched our unique funding, IP, and
        cyber-security needs. His experience with growth-stage businesses provided us with options that matched our stage
        and immediate concerns. We hope to tap into his experience when our security requirements change."

        "We brought Stephan in to accelerate delivery on a critical integration project. He executed in record time, providing our front-end teams with Just-in-Time API resources as we finalized email providers, payment gateways, and AWS infrastructure decisions. His practical approach delivered both working solutions and best practices for API testing, JWT security, and a framework our team could extend. He restored delivery cadence and helped us ship a critical initiative in 4 weeks—exactly the execution leadership we needed."

        "Stephan's contribution to Qase has been extraordinary: he found ways to reduce platform spend by 
        80%, decrease data migration time by 90%, all while improving Qase's resilience and security. 
        Even more incredible is how he achieved this: instead of dictating solutions, he actively coached 
        and mentored our existing staff, helping them to identify and implement new, better approaches. 
        It's also rare to find a CTO equally comfortable in both the boardroom and the trenches. I highly 
        recommend Stephan to any growth-stage business looking to optimize costs, improve delivery, and scale their team effectively."
