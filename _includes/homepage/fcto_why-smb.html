    Why use a fractional CTO?
    </h2>
    <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
      A fractional CTO brings tech perspective from clients that dedicated teams lack because 
      they're in execution mode. Someone needs to be watching the patterns—identifying what's 
      working across businesses, spotting emerging risks, and recognizing opportunities your 
      team might miss while heads-down on delivery.
