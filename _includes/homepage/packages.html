          Offshoring CTO Services
        </h4>
      </div>

        <p>
          The lure of offshoring teams is huge. The challenges are 
          there, but often unseen. Domestic projects and offshore teams
          thrive when a technology mediator bridges the two communities:
          business and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The Challenge:</b> Technology is not a turn key. It 
          requires trust, both between business challenges and tech 
          providers. Business founders think in term of domestic 
          needs, markets and objectives, while developers think in terms of 
          execution, requirements and delivery. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The Solution: </b> As an 'Offshoring CTO', I provide a bridge between requirements
          and on-shore tech cultures. I build trust, and enable offshore teams to deliver value
          to non-technical founders.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Duration:</b> Lifetime of the project. This type of project 
          requires hands on work to build the team, support the mission, 
          and ensure the team is aligned with the business.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>The Secret: </b> Good offshore companies will (often) NOT take on clients
          that lack technology leadership. These companies have learned from past experience
          that good outsourcing needs good tech leaders, that is trusted by the client's
          leadership <!--(<a href="/outsourcing-101">read more</a>)-->. They get burned when Non-tech founders try to 'wing it'. It causes
          the outsourcing company hiring and retention issues when their people are 
          deployed to a client without dedicated resources who is experience in running 
          a tech team. 
        </p>

          <b>Type of Engagement:</b> Fractional Only.

          On-Demand Tech Co-Founder
        </h4>

        <p>
          CEOs and Founders often need an outside perspective on 
          their technology challenges. This perspective can be in the 
          form of communications and mediation, that allow a business 
          leader to navigate challenges in how their teams deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes they need someone who will think like a founder
          and provide that key approach that moves their thinking 
          and their business forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Duration:</b> This type of work is often short term, and 
          driven by a specific pain point, hiring challenge or tech 
          pattern. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Who:</b> I and team of seasoned CTOs can help 
          a founder navigate challenges and gain insights and solutions.
          Over the post few years I have built a network of builders,
          coders and tech leaders. I leverage network to get 
          fresh approaches.
