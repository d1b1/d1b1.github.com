  My Perspective
</h2>

<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
  Startups are all unique, but the pathways, pitfalls and
  blockers are not. Constant reinvention is a requirement
  to turn a vision into a reality. To understand how I approach
  the startup condition, here are some of the patterns and
  anti-patterns I have encountered and how I address them.

          When a founding team is heads down and building, context is hard

          "Context is KING". A fractional CTO can help
          bridge the gap when tech challenges are impacting
          revenue and growth. It can build in source of new patterns
          and solutions.

          Founding teams build on what they know when they
          get started. When driving for revenue, its hard to

          Changing tech stack and processes requires
          a different technique, patterns and approaches.
          Assuming a complete refactor will solve problems
          is a common anti-pattern.

          This is a common warning to founders. Your assumptions
          about your customers and their needs can be a huge
          blocker to getting your company to <b>revenue positive</b>.

          A framework for scoring solutions can help

          breaking the 'this worked so far' approach.

          is cheap, fast and too valuable to pass up or ignore. Startups raise money to hire tech.
          Tech costs often do not correlate to revenue growth. Tech decisions
          can enable teams break assumptions about their customers needs.
