    How I engage.
  </h2>
  <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
    I work with your existing team and vendors to stabilize delivery and drive measurable outcomes. 
    Packaged engagements: <b>Tech & Delivery Diagnostic</b> to identify constraints, <b>fixed-scope sprint</b> 
    for targeted wins, and optional <b>interim CTO coverage</b> to maintain cadence. You own decisions 
    and execution—I provide leadership leverage.

    <em>I take on 2.5 clients at a time—meaning 2 active engagements and 1 advisory—to ensure focused attention and measurable outcomes.</em>
