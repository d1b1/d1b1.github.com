  Every business is unique, but the tech leadership challenges are predictable: delivery stalls, priorities blur, and risk increases. Here are patterns I've observed and how I address them.

          When the CTO seat is empty or overloaded, priorities get lost and 
          learnings fade as teams rush to deliver.

        <td>&rarr;</td>
        <td>
          Clear decision frameworks and priority alignment restore delivery cadence. 
          Interim leadership bridges the gap when tech challenges impact revenue.

        <td>
          Teams can be siloed into a specific approach or tech stack, limiting 
          scalability and making change feel risky.
        </td>
        <td>&rarr;</td>
        <td>
          An outside perspective helps leadership rethink tech stack and processes—identifying 
          constraints and modernizing pragmatically. A complete rebuild is rarely necessary.

      <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="d-none d-md-table-cell text-start">Assumptions</th>
        <td>
          "What got you here won't get you there." Assumptions about 
          tech needs and customer requirements can block growth and 
          limit scalability.

        <td>
          Decision frameworks help break the "this worked so far" mindset 
          and align tech choices with business outcomes. Tech debt isn't bad—it's 
          misunderstood when managed strategically.

        <th scope="row" class="d-none d-md-table-cell text-start">Myths</th>
        <td>
          Common myths drive tech decisions: "We need more developers," 
          "Custom code is always better," or "Tech costs scale with revenue."
        </td>
        <td>&rarr;</td>
        <td>
          Low-code and no-code solutions are often faster and cheaper than custom 
          development. Tech costs don't always correlate with revenue growth. 
          The right tech decisions enable teams to scale without proportional cost increases.

      <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="d-none d-md-table-cell text-start">Experimentation</th>
        <td>
          Teams know experiments are important, but making them happen 
          consistently can challenge even agile teams.
        </td>
        <td>&rarr;</td>
        <td>
          An <b>experiment and measure</b> mindset breaks assumption deadlocks 
          and helps teams identify productivity gains without over-committing to 
          unproven solutions.

          Teams grow, but productivity can remain <b>stagnant</b>. 
          More people don't always mean faster delivery.

        <td>&rarr;</td>
        <td>
          Teams and processes need tuning against metrics that align with 
          business milestones. Decision frameworks help score solutions and 
          promote tech choices that align with growth outcomes.

          Custom code is often the default solution. CEOs assume they need
